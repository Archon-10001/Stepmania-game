# Stepmania-game
A knock off of the open source game Stepmania, I made this game in two days in order to improve my programming skills the purpose of the game 
is to hit the falling notes when they are on top of the indicators at the bottom of the screen, the speed at which these notes fall increases on a 10 second timer. So the aim of the game is essentially to survive as long as you can, before the notes overwhelm you!
