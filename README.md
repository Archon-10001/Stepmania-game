# Stepmania-game
A knock off of the open source game Stepmania, I made this game in two days in order to improve my programming skills the purpose of the game 
is to hit the falling notes when they are on top of the indicators at the bottom of the screen, and as the game goes on the speed at which these
notes fall is going to steadily increase!
